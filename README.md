# Comparative Analysis of the Iris and Amazon Prime Datasets

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment performs a **comparative analysis of two datasets**:

* **Iris Dataset** – a classic dataset in machine learning, often used for classification problems.
* **Amazon Prime Dataset** – containing information about movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime, enabling insights into content distribution, ratings, and other metadata.

The goal of this assignment is to explore, analyze, and compare both datasets using data visualization, statistical summaries, and machine learning techniques where applicable.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using the following tools and libraries:

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – machine learning (if applied)
